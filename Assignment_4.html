        <h1>Stratovolcanoes</h1>
        <div>
            Strato Volcanoes comprise the largest percentage (~60%) of the Earth's individual volcanoes and most are characterized by eruptions of <span style="color: blue;"><u>andesite</u></span> and <span style="color: blue;"><u>docile</u></span>-lavas that are cooler and more visccus than
               <span style="color: blue;"><u>basalt.</u></span> These more viscous lavas allow gas pressures to build up to high levels (they are effective "plugs" in the plumbing), therefore these volcanoes often suffer explosive eruptions.

               Strato volcanoes are usually about half-half lava and <span style="color: blue;"><u>pyroclastic</u></span> material, and the layering of these products gives them their 
               other common name of composite volcanoes.
               Left : This is a schematic diagram of a strato volcano, intended to illustrate the different layers of different materials that 
               comprise them. The purple colors are meant to represent <span style="color: blue;"><u>ash</u></span> layers, either the products of fall-out from big eruption clouds or 
               the products of pyroclastic flows. Notice that these ash layers tend to be thin but widespread. The orange colors represent lava flows, and note that some of them have cinder 
               cones associated with them at the <span style="color: blue;"><u>vent</u></span>. The green colors are meant to represent lava domes, and notice that they do not flow very far. 
               Each eruption, regardless of what it produces, is fed from the <span style="color: blue;"><u>magma chamber</u></span> by a <span style="color: blue;"><u>dike</u></span>. Most dikes come up through the center of the volcano 
               and therefore most eruptions occur from at or near the summit. However, some dikes head off sideways to feed eruptions on the flanks.

              Right: This is a pit that has been dug into the ground at Cotopaxi, a big strato volcano near Quito, the capital city of Ecuador. The pit is about 2 meters deep and in it you can clearly see a number of ash layers exposed. It is also easy to see that the layers are different - some are coarse and others are fine, some are dark-colored and others are light-colored.

                  The lava at strato vaolcanoes occassionally forms <span style="color: blue;"><u>'a'a</u></span> but more commonly it barely dlows at all,prefferring to pile up inthe vent to form
                  Volcanic domes.Some strato volcanoes are just collection of domes piled up on each other.Strato volcanoes are commonly found along
                  subduction-related volcanic arcs, and the <span style="color: blue;"><u>magma</u></span> supply rates to strato volcanoes are lower.This is the cause of the cooler and differentiated
                  magma compositions and the reason for the usually long <span style="color: blue;"><u>repose</u></span> periods between eruptions.Example of the strato volcanoes include Mt. st
                  Helens, Mt.Rainer,Pinatudo,Mt.fuji, Galera, Cotopaxi and super plenty others.
